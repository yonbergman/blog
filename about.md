<h1 class='about-me'>About Yon</h1>

Yonatan Bergman is a developer and an amateur designer who loves building cool stuff.  
By day, he works as a tech-lead at the <a href='http://notninjas.com/'>eBay Israel Innovation Center</a> - a commando unit aiming to produce the next big (awesome) thing.  
By night, he works relentlessly on his side projects and plays probably too many board games.  

Yon is based in Israel where he helps lead the Israeli Ruby scene,
he is a frequent mentor at <a href='http://railsgirls.co.il/'>RailsGirls</a>
and a co-founder of the Israeli <a href='http://coderetreat.co.il/'>Global Day of Coderetreat</a>.
