I had the absolute pleasure of speaking at this year's [Golden Gate Ruby Conference](http://gogaruco.com/speakers/#ybergman) in San Francisco.
It was my first time speaking outside of Israel and it was awesome.

I want to thank the organizers [@wifelette](https://twitter.com/wifelette) [@joshsusser](https://twitter.com/joshsusser) [@purp](https://twitter.com/purp) & [@sarahmei](https://twitter.com/sarahmei) for organizing an aswesome conference.  
I was sad to hear that this was the last GoGaRuCo - but was honored to not only attend for the third time but to get to speak at the last GoGaRuCo.
A big shout out goes out to all the other attendees of the conference and especially the other speakers - you were all awesome and super nice.

## Talk Summary

In my talk I shared the story of how I built and designed my first board game, how ruby helped me hone and optimize the game mechanics and parameters.  
I started with a short intro to board gaming right now, what goes into making a game and I continued with my experiences while building [Missiles & Microchips](/missiles_and_microchips).
