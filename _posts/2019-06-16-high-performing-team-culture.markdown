I gave a talk in Reversim 2019 on engineering excellence and growing high performing engineering organizations.

<!--more-->

What does it mean to strive for ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE? As your engineering organization grows, you want to encourage teams and individuals to develop and improve their technical proficiency and practices. Growth puts stress on your teams' ability to deliver kick-ass code consistently. To help them improve and grow, we built the LEVEL UP model to represent everything that's expected of an excellent engineering team.

In this talk, Iâ€™ll review why we built this model, refined it and how we got teams to adopt it and the effects that it had on our department. I will also give you the tools to either use our model or fork your own specific one for your organization.
