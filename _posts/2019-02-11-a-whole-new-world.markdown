I recently gave an talk at the new WiX Haifa meetup on the topic of I18N (Internationalization), G11N (Globalization) and L10N (Localization).

<!--more-->

So you’ve launched your first service and all your customers in the US love it - great! 
Now comes the hard part - how do you make the entire world love it too.

In this talk, I’m going to share what from my experience building the PayPal Mobile app and expanding WeWork’s systems to span the globe.I’m going to cover it all: from encodings, translations, UGC, CATs, i18n, g11n, l10n, LQA, money, dates, names, and taxes. 
So that you can expand your app and reach new customers in London, Beijing, Tel-Aviv, and Paris.
