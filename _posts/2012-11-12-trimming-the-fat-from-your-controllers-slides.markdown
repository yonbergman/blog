Today I gave a talk on **How to trim the fat from your controllers** at [#railsisrael](http://railsisrael.events.co.il/presentations/551-trimming-the-fat-from-your-controllers).

It was a real fun conference and it was awesome meeting lots of passionate Ruby devs in Israel.

Hope you enjoyed my talk - would love to get feedback.

I will post a more in depth look at improving controllers and extracting code soon and I'll update here when it's up.
