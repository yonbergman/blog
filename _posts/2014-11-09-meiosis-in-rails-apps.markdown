After coming back from an exiting trip to the US and talking at GOGARUCO I had the chance to give a more technical talk this year in my own city of Tel-Aviv.

<!--more-->

Last week we had the 3rd Israeli Rails conference in Tel-Aviv and I had fun meeting all the guests coming to give talks and share a drink with them.

I also gave a more technical talk about splitting a Rails app into several apps and gems and gave a case study for an app I got to work on.
